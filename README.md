NetApp OCUM Zenpack

This document provides information on the Community ZenPack created by NetApp IT called “NetApp-OCUM”.  The NetApp OnCommand Unified Manager (OCUM) server monitors events from NetApp storage appliances.  Events are categorized by the type of impact area such as availability, capacity, configuration, or protection.  Those events are forwarded as SNMP traps to Zenoss for centralized monitoring and notification via emails or tickets if Zenoss is integrated with Service Now.  This ZenPack can be downloaded and installed into Zenoss Resource Manager server to monitor traps sent from the NetApp OnCommand Unified Manager (OCUM) server.
